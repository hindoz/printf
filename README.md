This is for printf function which is going to print its arguments to stdout
based on its format specifier.

Each specifier will reflect specific type of data, and it start with percentage sign(%).

For example :

using %d  to print an integar number.

%c for typing one character and %s for string.

This  function will test the format specifier and then calling the appropriate function for it.
